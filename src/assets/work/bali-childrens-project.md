## Bali Children's Project

I provided affordable reduced cost development services for this non-profit charitable organization and used knowledge of HTML4, CSS2 and PHP4 to translate existing design specifications into functional plugins and themes to function with Wordpress 4.1.

Additional responsibilities on this project included automating rapid deployment of large quantities of existing content and providing technical consultation on certain aspects of user interface design and technology choices to best serve the client's present and future needs.
