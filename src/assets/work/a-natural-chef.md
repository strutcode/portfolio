## A Natural Chef

This project consisted of full stack web development based on Wordpress 4.3. Responsibilities included server and database set-up, platform configuration, security and initial content deployment.

Look and feel of the site was achieved with a hand coded template based on Photoshop design files including flexible menu and sidebar systems using existing Wordpress features.
